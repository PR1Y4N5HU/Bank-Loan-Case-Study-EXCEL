This project serves as a case study that explores the loan lending process in banks, focusing on the methods employed to minimize the company's loss, including the utilization of risk analytics. The primary objective is to gain insights into the driving factors behind loan defaults and understand how Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is applied in real-life scenarios, particularly by banks when dealing with large datasets.

The loan lending process in banks is a critical aspect of their operations, and minimizing the risk of defaults is crucial to maintaining financial stability. By examining this process, we aim to uncover the various methods and strategies employed by banks to mitigate potential losses and assess the effectiveness of risk analytics in this context.
